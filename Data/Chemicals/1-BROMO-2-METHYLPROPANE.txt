HOW TO DETERMINE IF YOU ARE BEING
EXPOSED
The New Jersey Right to Know Act requires most employers
to label chemicals in the workplace and requires public
employers to provide their employees with information and
training concerning chemical hazards and controls. The
federal OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, 1910.1200,
requires private employers to provide similar training and
information to their employees.
* Exposure to hazardous substances should be routinely
evaluated. This may include collecting personal and area
air samples. You can obtain copies of sampling results
from your employer. You have a legal right to this
information under OSHA 1910.1020.
* If you think you are experiencing any work-related health
problems, see a doctor trained to recognize occupational
diseases. Take this Fact Sheet with you.

* Where possible, enclose operations and use local exhaust
ventilation at the site of chemical release. If local exhaust
ventilation or enclosure is not used, respirators should be
worn.
* Wear protective work clothing.
* Wash thoroughly immediately after exposure to 1-Bromo2-Methylpropane and at the end of the workshift.
* Post hazard and warning information in the work area. In
addition, as part of an ongoing education and training
effort, communicate all information on the health and
safety hazards of 1-Bromo-2-Methylpropane to
potentially exposed workers.

1-BROMO-2-METHYLPROPANE
This Fact Sheet is a summary source of information of all
potential and most severe health hazards that may result from
exposure.
Duration of exposure, concentration of the
substance and other factors will affect your susceptibility to
any of the potential effects described below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

HEALTH HAZARD INFORMATION
Acute Health Effects
The following acute (short-term) health effects may occur
immediately or shortly after exposure to 1-Bromo-2Methylpropane:
* Contact can irritate the skin and eyes.

Chronic Health Effects
The following chronic (long-term) health effects can occur at
some time after exposure to 1-Bromo-2-Methylpropane and
can last for months or years:

Cancer Hazard
* There is limited evidence that 1-Bromo-2-Methylpropane
causes lung cancer in animals.
* Many scientists believe there is no safe level of exposure
to a carcinogen. Such substances may also have the
potential for causing reproductive damage in humans.

Reproductive Hazard
* According to the information presently available to the
New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services,
1-Bromo-2-Methylpropane has not been tested for its
ability to affect reproduction.

Other Long-Term Effects
* No chronic (long-term) health effects are known at this
time.

MEDICAL
Medical Testing
There is no special test for this chemical. However, if illness
occurs or overexposure is suspected, medical attention is
recommended.
Any evaluation should include a careful history of past and
present symptoms with an exam. Medical tests that look for
damage already done are not a substitute for controlling
exposure.
Request copies of your medical testing. You have a legal
right to this information under OSHA 1910.1020.

WORKPLACE CONTROLS AND PRACTICES
Unless a less toxic chemical can be substituted for a hazardous
substance, ENGINEERING CONTROLS are the most
effective way of reducing exposure. The best protection is to
enclose operations and/or provide local exhaust ventilation at
the site of chemical release. Isolating operations can also
reduce exposure. Using respirators or protective equipment is
less effective than the controls mentioned above, but is
sometimes necessary.
In evaluating the controls present in your workplace, consider:
(1) how hazardous the substance is, (2) how much of the
substance is released into the workplace and (3) whether
harmful skin or eye contact could occur. Special controls
should be in place for highly toxic chemicals or when
significant skin, eye, or breathing exposures are possible.
In addition, the following controls are recommended:
* Where possible, automatically pump liquid 1-Bromo-2Methylpropane from drums or other storage containers to
process containers.
* Before entering a confined space where 1-Bromo-2Methylpropane may be present, check to make sure that
an explosive concentration does not exist.
Good WORK PRACTICES can help to reduce hazardous
exposures. The following work practices are recommended:
* Workers whose clothing has been contaminated by
1-Bromo-2-Methylpropane should change into clean
clothing promptly.
* Contaminated work clothes should be laundered by
individuals who have been informed of the hazards of
exposure to 1-Bromo-2-Methylpropane.
* Eye wash fountains should be provided in the immediate
work area for emergency use.
* If there is the possibility of skin exposure, emergency
shower facilities should be provided.
* On skin contact with 1-Bromo-2-Methylpropane,
immediately wash or shower to remove the chemical. At
the end of the workshift, wash any areas of the body that
may have contacted 1-Bromo-2-Methylpropane, whether
or not known skin contact has occurred.
* Do not eat, smoke, or drink where 1-Bromo-2Methylpropane is handled, processed, or stored, since the
chemical can be swallowed. Wash hands carefully before
eating, drinking, smoking, or using the toilet.

PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
WORKPLACE CONTROLS ARE BETTER THAN
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. However, for
some jobs (such as outside work, confined space entry, jobs
done only once in a while, or jobs done while workplace
controls are being installed), personal protective equipment
may be appropriate.

page 3 of 6

1-BROMO-2-METHYLPROPANE
OSHA 1910.132 requires employers to determine the
appropriate personal protective equipment for each hazard and
to train employees on how and when to use protective
equipment.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q:
A:

The following recommendations are only guidelines and may
not apply to every situation.
Q:

Clothing
* Avoid skin contact with 1-Bromo-2-Methylpropane.
Wear protective gloves and clothing. Safety equipment
suppliers/manufacturers can provide recommendations on
the most protective glove/clothing material for your
operation.
* All protective clothing (suits, gloves, footwear, headgear)
should be clean, available each day, and put on before
work.

A:

Q:
A:

Eye Protection
* Wear indirect-vent, impact and splash resistant goggles
when working with liquids.
* Wear a face shield along with goggles when working with
corrosive, highly irritating or toxic substances.

* Where the potential for overexposure exists, use a
MSHA/NIOSH approved supplied-air respirator with a full
facepiece operated in a pressure-demand or other positivepressure mode.
For increased protection use in
combination with an auxiliary self-contained breathing
apparatus operated in a pressure-demand or other positivepressure mode.

HANDLING AND STORAGE
* Prior to working with 1-Bromo-2-Methylpropane you
should be trained on its proper handling and storage.
* 1-Bromo-2-Methylpropane is not compatible with
OXIDIZING AGENTS (such as PERCHLORATES,
PEROXIDES, PERMANGANATES, CHLORATES,
NITRATES, CHLORINE, BROMINE and FLUORINE)
and STRONG BASES (such as SODIUM HYDROXIDE
and POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE).
* Store in tightly closed containers in a cool, well-ventilated
area.
* Sources of ignition, such as smoking and open flames, are
prohibited where 1-Bromo-2-Methylpropane is used,
handled, or stored.
* Metal containers involving the transfer of 1-Bromo-2Methylpropane should be grounded and bonded.
* Use only non-sparking tools and equipment, especially
when opening and closing containers of 1-Bromo-2Methylpropane.

Can I get long-term effects without ever having shortterm effects?
Yes, because long-term effects can occur from repeated
exposures to a chemical at levels not high enough to
make you immediately sick.
What are my chances of getting sick when I have been
exposed to chemicals?
The likelihood of becoming sick from chemicals is
increased as the amount of exposure increases. This is
determined by the length of time and the amount of
material to which someone is exposed.

Q:
A:

When are higher exposures more likely?
Conditions which increase risk of exposure include
physical and mechanical processes (heating, pouring,
spraying, spills and evaporation from large surface areas
such as open containers), and "confined space"
exposures (working inside vats, reactors, boilers, small
rooms, etc.).

Q:

Is the risk of getting sick higher for workers than for
community residents?
Yes. Exposures in the community, except possibly in
cases of fires or spills, are usually much lower than those
found in the workplace. However, people in the
community may be exposed to contaminated water as
well as to chemicals in the air over long periods. This
may be a problem for children or people who are already
ill.

Respiratory Protection
IMPROPER USE OF RESPIRATORS IS DANGEROUS.
Such equipment should only be used if the employer has a
written program that takes into account workplace conditions,
requirements for worker training, respirator fit testing and
medical exams, as described in OSHA 1910.134.

If I have acute health effects, will I later get chronic
health effects?
Not always. Most chronic (long-term) effects result
from repeated exposures to a chemical.

A:

Q:
A:

Don't all chemicals cause cancer?
No. Most chemicals tested by scientists are not cancercausing.

Q:

Should I be concerned if a chemical causes cancer in
animals?
Yes. Most scientists agree that a chemical that causes
cancer in animals should be treated as a suspected human
carcinogen unless proven otherwise.

A:

Q:
A:

But don't they test animals using much higher levels of a
chemical than people usually are exposed to?
Yes. That's so effects can be seen more clearly using
fewer animals. But high doses alone don't cause cancer
unless it's a cancer agent. In fact, a chemical that causes
cancer in animals at high doses could cause cancer in
humans exposed to low doses.
