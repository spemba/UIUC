HAZARD SUMMARY

WORKPLACE EXPOSURE LIMITS

* 1-Chloro-2-Propanol can affect you when breathed in
and by passing through your skin.
* Because this is a MUTAGEN, handle it as a possible
carcinogen--WITH EXTREME CAUTION.
* Contact can irritate the skin.
* 1-Chloro-2-Propanol can severely irritate and burn the
eyes.
* Breathing 1-Chloro-2-Propanol can irritate the nose and
throat.

ACGIH:

IDENTIFICATION

WAYS OF REDUCING EXPOSURE

1-Chloro-2-Propanol is a colorless liquid with a mild Etherlike odor. It is used to make other chemicals.

REASON FOR CITATION
* 1-Chloro-2-Propanol is on the Hazardous Substance List
because it is cited by ACGIH, DOT and NFPA.
* This chemical is on the Special Health Hazard Substance
List because it is a MUTAGEN.
* Definitions are provided on page 5.

HOW TO DETERMINE IF YOU ARE BEING
EXPOSED
The New Jersey Right to Know Act requires most employers
to label chemicals in the workplace and requires public
employers to provide their employees with information and
training concerning chemical hazards and controls. The
federal OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, 1910.1200,
requires private employers to provide similar training and
information to their employees.
* Exposure to hazardous substances should be routinely
evaluated. This may include collecting personal and area
air samples. You can obtain copies of sampling results
from your employer. You have a legal right to this
information under OSHA 1910.1020.
* If you think you are experiencing any work-related health
problems, see a doctor trained to recognize occupational
diseases. Take this Fact Sheet with you.

The recommended airborne exposure limit is
1 ppm averaged over an 8-hour workshift.

* 1-Chloro-2-Propanol is a MUTAGEN. Mutagens may
have a cancer risk. All contact with this chemical should
be reduced to the lowest possible level.
* The above exposure limit is for air levels only. When skin
contact also occurs, you may be overexposed, even though
air levels are less than the limit listed above.

* Where possible, enclose operations and use local exhaust
ventilation at the site of chemical release. If local exhaust
ventilation or enclosure is not used, respirators should be
worn.
* Wear protective work clothing.
* Wash thoroughly immediately after exposure to 1-Chloro2-Propanol and at the end of the workshift.
* Post hazard and warning information in the work area. In
addition, as part of an ongoing education and training
effort, communicate all information on the health and
safety hazards of 1-Chloro-2-Propanol to potentially
exposed workers.

1-CHLORO-2-PROPANOL
This Fact Sheet is a summary source of information of all
potential and most severe health hazards that may result from
exposure. Duration of exposure, concentration of the substance
and other factors will affect your susceptibility to any of the
potential effects described below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

HEALTH HAZARD INFORMATION
Acute Health Effects
The following acute (short-term) health effects may occur
immediately or shortly after exposure to 1-Chloro-2Propanol:
* Contact can irritate the skin.
* 1-Chloro-2-Propanol can severely irritate and burn the
eyes.
* Breathing 1-Chloro-2-Propanol can irritate the nose and
throat.

Chronic Health Effects
The following chronic (long-term) health effects can occur at
some time after exposure to 1-Chloro-2-Propanol and can last
for months or years:

page 2 of 6
enclose operations and/or provide local exhaust ventilation at
the site of chemical release. Isolating operations can also
reduce exposure. Using respirators or protective equipment is
less effective than the controls mentioned above, but is
sometimes necessary.
In evaluating the controls present in your workplace, consider:
(1) how hazardous the substance is, (2) how much of the
substance is released into the workplace and (3) whether
harmful skin or eye contact could occur. Special controls
should be in place for highly toxic chemicals or when
significant skin, eye, or breathing exposures are possible.
In addition, the following control is recommended:
* Where possible, automatically pump liquid 1-Chloro-2Propanol from drums or other storage containers to process
containers.
Good WORK PRACTICES can help to reduce hazardous
exposures. The following work practices are recommended:

MEDICAL

* Workers whose clothing has been contaminated by
1-Chloro-2-Propanol should change into clean clothing
promptly.
* Contaminated work clothes should be laundered by
individuals who have been informed of the hazards of
exposure to 1-Chloro-2-Propanol.
* Eye wash fountains should be provided in the immediate
work area for emergency use.
* If there is the possibility of skin exposure, emergency
shower facilities should be provided.
* On skin contact with 1-Chloro-2-Propanol, immediately
wash or shower to remove the chemical. At the end of the
workshift, wash any areas of the body that may have
contacted 1-Chloro-2-Propanol, whether or not known
skin contact has occurred.
* Do not eat, smoke, or drink where 1-Chloro-2-Propanol is
handled, processed, or stored, since the chemical can be
swallowed. Wash hands carefully before eating, drinking,
smoking, or using the toilet.

Medical Testing

PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

Cancer Hazard
* 1-Chloro-2-Propanol causes MUTATIONS (genetic
changes). Such chemicals may have a cancer risk.
* Many scientists believe there is no safe level of exposure to
a carcinogen.

Reproductive Hazard
* While 1-Chloro-2-Propanol has been tested, it is not
classifiable as to its potential to cause reproductive harm.

Other Long-Term Effects
* 1-Chloro-2-Propanol has not been adequately tested for
other (long-term) health effects.

There is no special test for this chemical. However, if illness
occurs or overexposure is suspected, medical attention is
recommended.
Any evaluation should include a careful history of past and
present symptoms with an exam. Medical tests that look for
damage already done are not a substitute for controlling
exposure.
Request copies of your medical testing. You have a legal right
to this information under OSHA 1910.1020.

WORKPLACE CONTROLS AND PRACTICES
Unless a less toxic chemical can be substituted for a hazardous
substance, ENGINEERING CONTROLS are the most
effective way of reducing exposure. The best protection is to

WORKPLACE CONTROLS ARE BETTER THAN
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. However, for
some jobs (such as outside work, confined space entry, jobs
done only once in a while, or jobs done while workplace
controls are being installed), personal protective equipment
may be appropriate.
OSHA 1910.132 requires employers to determine the
appropriate personal protective equipment for each hazard and
to train employees on how and when to use protective
equipment.
The following recommendations are only guidelines and may
not apply to every situation.

Clothing
* Avoid skin contact with 1-Chloro-2-Propanol. Wear
protective gloves and clothing. Safety equipment
suppliers/manufacturers can provide recommendations on
the most protective glove/clothing material for your
operation.
* All protective clothing (suits, gloves, footwear, headgear)
should be clean, available each day, and put on before
work.
* Safety equipment manufacturers recommend Butyl Rubber
or Viton as protective materials.

Eye Protection

Q:
A:

Q:
A:

* Wear indirect-vent, impact and splash resistant goggles
when working with liquids.
* Wear a face shield along with goggles when working with
corrosive, highly irritating or toxic substances.

Respiratory Protection
IMPROPER USE OF RESPIRATORS IS DANGEROUS.
Such equipment should only be used if the employer has a
written program that takes into account workplace conditions,
requirements for worker training, respirator fit testing and
medical exams, as described in OSHA 1910.134.
* Where the potential exists for exposure over 1 ppm, use a
NIOSH approved supplied-air respirator with a full
facepiece operated in a pressure-demand or other positivepressure mode. For increased protection use in combination
with an auxiliary self-contained breathing apparatus
operated in a pressure-demand or other positive-pressure
mode.

Q:
A:

If I have acute health effects, will I later get chronic
health effects?
Not always. Most chronic (long-term) effects result from
repeated exposures to a chemical.
Can I get long-term effects without ever having shortterm effects?
Yes, because long-term effects can occur from repeated
exposures to a chemical at levels not high enough to make
you immediately sick.
What are my chances of getting sick when I have been
exposed to chemicals?
The likelihood of becoming sick from chemicals is
increased as the amount of exposure increases. This is
determined by the length of time and the amount of
material to which someone is exposed.
When are higher exposures more likely?
Conditions which increase risk of exposure include
physical and mechanical processes (heating, pouring,
spraying, spills and evaporation from large surface areas
such as open containers), and "confined space" exposures
(working inside vats, reactors, boilers, small rooms, etc.).

Q:
A:

Is the risk of getting sick higher for workers than for
community residents?
Yes. Exposures in the community, except possibly in
cases of fires or spills, are usually much lower than those
found in the workplace.
However, people in the
community may be exposed to contaminated water as
well as to chemicals in the air over long periods. This
may be a problem for children or people who are already
ill.
What are the likely health problems from chemicals which
cause mutations?
There are two primary health concerns associated with
mutagens: (1) cancers can result from changes induced in
cells and, (2) adverse reproductive and developmental
outcomes can result from damage to the egg and sperm
cells.
Don't all chemicals cause cancer?
No. Most chemicals tested by scientists are not cancercausing.
