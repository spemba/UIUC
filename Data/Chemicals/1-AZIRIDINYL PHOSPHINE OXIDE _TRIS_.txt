IDENTIFICATION
1-Aziridinyl Phosphine Oxide (Tris) is a colorless, sand-like
solid. It was used as a pesticide, flame retardant, and in
veterinary medication.

REASON FOR CITATION
* 1-Aziridinyl Phosphine Oxide (Tris) is on the Hazardous
Substance List because it is cited by DOT.
* Definitions are provided on page 5.

HOW TO DETERMINE IF YOU ARE BEING
EXPOSED
The New Jersey Right to Know Act requires most employers
to label chemicals in the workplace and requires public
employers to provide their employees with information and
training concerning chemical hazards and controls. The
federal OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, 1910.1200,
requires private employers to provide similar training and
information to their employees.
* Exposure to hazardous substances should be routinely
evaluated. This may include collecting personal and area
air samples. You can obtain copies of sampling results
from your employer. You have a legal right to this
information under OSHA 1910.1020.
* If you think you are experiencing any work-related health
problems, see a doctor trained to recognize occupational
diseases. Take this Fact Sheet with you.

No occupational exposure limits have been established for
1-Aziridinyl Phosphine Oxide (Tris). This does not mean
that this substance is not harmful. Safe work practices should
always be followed.
* 1-Aziridinyl Phosphine Oxide (Tris) may cause
mutations. All contact with this chemical should be
reduced to the lowest possible level.

WAYS OF REDUCING EXPOSURE
* Where possible, enclose operations and use local exhaust
ventilation at the site of chemical release. If local exhaust
ventilation or enclosure is not used, respirators should be
worn.
* Wear protective work clothing.
* Wash thoroughly immediately after exposure to
1-Aziridinyl Phosphine Oxide (Tris) and at the end of
the workshift.
* Post hazard and warning information in the work area. In
addition, as part of an ongoing education and training
effort, communicate all information on the health and
safety hazards of 1-Aziridinyl Phosphine Oxide (Tris) to
potentially exposed workers.

1-AZIRIDINYL PHOSPHINE OXIDE (TRIS)
This Fact Sheet is a summary source of information of all
potential and most severe health hazards that may result from
exposure. Duration of exposure, concentration of the substance
and other factors will affect your susceptibility to any of the
potential effects described below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

HEALTH HAZARD INFORMATION
Acute Health Effects
The following acute (short-term) health effects may occur
immediately or shortly after exposure to 1-Aziridinyl
Phosphine Oxide (Tris):
* Contact can irritate and burn the skin.
* Exposure to 1-Aziridinyl Phosphine Oxide (Tris) can
irritate the eyes, nose, and throat.

Chronic Health Effects
The following chronic (long-term) health effects can occur at
some time after exposure to 1-Aziridinyl Phosphine Oxide
(Tris) and can last for months or years:

Cancer Hazard
* 1-Aziridinyl Phosphine Oxide (Tris) may cause mutations
(genetic changes). Whether or not it poses a cancer hazard
needs further study.

Reproductive Hazard
* 1-Aziridinyl Phosphine Oxide (Tris) may damage the
developing fetus.

Other Long-Term Effects
* 1-Aziridinyl Phosphine Oxide (Tris) has not been tested
for other chronic (long-term) health effects.

MEDICAL
Medical Testing
There is no special test for this chemical. However, if illness
occurs or overexposure is suspected, medical attention is
recommended.
Any evaluation should include a careful history of past and
present symptoms with an exam. Medical tests that look for
damage already done are not a substitute for controlling
exposure.
Request copies of your medical testing. You have a legal right
to this information under OSHA 1910.1020.

WORKPLACE CONTROLS AND PRACTICES
Unless a less toxic chemical can be substituted for a hazardous
substance, ENGINEERING CONTROLS are the most
effective way of reducing exposure. The best protection is to
enclose operations and/or provide local exhaust ventilation at
the site of chemical release. Isolating operations can also
reduce exposure. Using respirators or protective equipment is

page 2 of 6
less effective than the controls mentioned above, but is
sometimes necessary.
In evaluating the controls present in your workplace, consider:
(1) how hazardous the substance is, (2) how much of the
substance is released into the workplace and (3) whether
harmful skin or eye contact could occur. Special controls
should be in place for highly toxic chemicals or when
significant skin, eye, or breathing exposures are possible.
In addition, the following control is recommended:
* Where possible, automatically transfer 1-Aziridinyl
Phosphine Oxide (Tris) from drums or other storage
containers to process containers.
Good WORK PRACTICES can help to reduce hazardous
exposures. The following work practices are recommended:
* Workers whose clothing has been contaminated by
1-Aziridinyl Phosphine Oxide (Tris) should change into
clean clothing promptly.
* Do not take contaminated work clothes home. Family
members could be exposed.
* Contaminated work clothes should be laundered by
individuals who have been informed of the hazards of
exposure to 1-Aziridinyl Phosphine Oxide (Tris).
* Eye wash fountains should be provided in the immediate
work area for emergency use.
* If there is the possibility of skin exposure, emergency
shower facilities should be provided.
* On skin contact with 1-Aziridinyl Phosphine Oxide
(Tris), immediately wash or shower to remove the
chemical. At the end of the workshift, wash any areas of
the body that may have contacted 1-Aziridinyl Phosphine
Oxide (Tris), whether or not known skin contact has
occurred.
* Do not eat, smoke, or drink where 1-Aziridinyl Phosphine
Oxide (Tris) is handled, processed, or stored, since the
chemical can be swallowed. Wash hands carefully before
eating, drinking, smoking, or using the toilet.
* Use a vacuum or a wet method to reduce dust during cleanup. DO NOT DRY SWEEP.

PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
WORKPLACE CONTROLS ARE BETTER THAN
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. However, for
some jobs (such as outside work, confined space entry, jobs
done only once in a while, or jobs done while workplace
controls are being installed), personal protective equipment
may be appropriate.
OSHA 1910.132 requires employers to determine the
appropriate personal protective equipment for each hazard and
to train employees on how and when to use protective
equipment.
The following recommendations are only guidelines and may
not apply to every situation.

1-AZIRIDINYL PHOSPHINE OXIDE (TRIS)
Clothing
* Avoid skin contact with 1-Aziridinyl Phosphine Oxide
(Tris). Wear protective gloves and clothing. Safety
equipment
suppliers/manufacturers
can
provide
recommendations on the most protective glove/clothing
material for your operation.
* All protective clothing (suits, gloves, footwear, headgear)
should be clean, available each day, and put on before
work.

Eye Protection
* Wear impact resistant eye protection with side shields or
goggles.
* Wear a face shield along with goggles when working with
corrosive, highly irritating or toxic substances.

Respiratory Protection
IMPROPER USE OF RESPIRATORS IS DANGEROUS.
Such equipment should only be used if the employer has a
written program that takes into account workplace conditions,
requirements for worker training, respirator fit testing and
medical exams, as described in OSHA 1910.134.
* For field applications check with your supervisor and your
safety equipment supplier regarding the appropriate
respiratory equipment.
* NIOSH has established new testing and certification
requirements for negative pressure, air purifying, particulate
filter and filtering facepiece respirators.
The filter
classifications of dust/mist/fume, paint spray or pesticide
prefilters, and filters for radon daughters, have been
replaced with the N, R, and P series. Each series has three
levels of filtering efficiency: 95%, 99%, and 99.9%.
Check with your safety equipment supplier or your
respirator manufacturer to determine which respirator is
appropriate for your facility.
* If while wearing a filter or cartridge respirator you can
smell, taste, or otherwise detect 1-Aziridinyl Phosphine
Oxide (Tris), or if while wearing particulate filters
abnormal resistance to breathing is experienced, or eye
irritation occurs while wearing a full facepiece respirator,
leave the area immediately. Check to make sure the
respirator-to-face seal is still good. If it is, replace the filter
or cartridge. If the seal is no longer good, you may need a
new respirator.
* Be sure to consider all potential exposures in your
workplace. You may need a combination of filters,
prefilters or cartridges to protect against different forms of a
chemical (such as vapor and mist) or against a mixture of
chemicals.
* Where the potential for high exposure exists, use a NIOSH
approved supplied-air respirator with a full facepiece
operated in a pressure-demand or other positive-pressure
mode. For increased protection use in combination with an
auxiliary self-contained breathing apparatus operated in a
pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q:

Q:
A:

If I have acute health effects, will I later get chronic
health effects?
Not always. Most chronic (long-term) effects result from
repeated exposures to a chemical.
Can I get long-term effects without ever having shortterm effects?
Yes, because long-term effects can occur from repeated
exposures to a chemical at levels not high enough to make
you immediately sick.
What are my chances of getting sick when I have been
exposed to chemicals?
The likelihood of becoming sick from chemicals is
increased as the amount of exposure increases. This is
determined by the length of time and the amount of
material to which someone is exposed.

Q:
A:

When are higher exposures more likely?
Conditions which increase risk of exposure include dust
releasing operations (grinding, mixing, blasting, dumping,
etc.), other physical and mechanical processes (heating,
pouring, spraying, spills and evaporation from large
surface areas such as open containers), and "confined
space" exposures (working inside vats, reactors, boilers,
small rooms, etc.).

Q:

Is the risk of getting sick higher for workers than for
community residents?
Yes. Exposures in the community, except possibly in
cases of fires or spills, are usually much lower than those
found in the workplace.
However, people in the
community may be exposed to contaminated water as
well as to chemicals in the air over long periods. This
may be a problem for children or people who are already
ill.

Q:
A:

What are the likely health problems from chemicals which
cause mutations?
There are two primary health concerns associated with
mutagens: (1) cancers can result from changes induced in
cells and, (2) adverse reproductive and developmental
outcomes can result from damage to the egg and sperm
cells.
Can men as well as women be affected by chemicals that
cause reproductive system damage?
Yes. Some chemicals reduce potency or fertility in both
men and women. Some damage sperm and eggs, possibly
leading to birth defects.
Who is at the greatest risk from reproductive hazards?
Pregnant women are at greatest risk from chemicals that
harm the developing fetus. However, chemicals may
affect the ability to have children, so both men and
women of childbearing age are at high risk.
