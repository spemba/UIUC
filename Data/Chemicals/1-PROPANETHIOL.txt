Sheet (MSDS) and the label to determine product
ingredients and important safety and health information
about the product mixture.
f For each individual hazardous ingredient, read the New

Jersey Department of Health Hazardous Substance Fact
Sheet, available on the RTK website
(www.nj.gov/health/eoh/rtkweb) or in your facility’s RTK
Central File or Hazard Communication Standard file.
f You have a right to this information under the New Jersey

Worker and Community Right to Know Act, the Public
Employees Occupational Safety and Health (PEOSH) Act
if you are a public worker in New Jersey, and under the
federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) if you
are a private worker.
f The New Jersey Right to Know Act requires most

employers to label chemicals in the workplace and
requires public employers to provide their employees with
information concerning chemical hazards and controls.
The federal OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (29
CFR 1910.1200) and the PEOSH Hazard Communication
Standard (N.J.A.C. 12:100-7) require employers to provide
similar information and training to their employees.
This Fact Sheet is a summary of available information
regarding the health hazards that may result from exposure.
Duration of exposure, concentration of the substance and other
factors will affect your susceptibility to any of the potential
effects described below.

Health Hazard Information
Acute Health Effects
The following acute (short-term) health effects may occur
immediately or shortly after exposure to 1-Propanethiol:
f Contact can irritate the skin and eyes and may cause a skin

rash.
f Inhaling 1-Propanethiol can irritate the nose, throat and

lungs causing coughing, wheezing and/or shortness of
breath.
f Exposure to 1-Propanethiol can cause headache,
dizziness, nausea, muscle weakness, convulsions and
unconsciousness.
Chronic Health Effects
The following chronic (long-term) health effects can occur at
some time after exposure to 1-Propanethiol and can last for
months or years:
Cancer Hazard
f According to the information presently available to the New
Jersey Department of Health, 1-Propanethiol has not been
tested for its ability to cause cancer in animals.

Reproductive Hazard
f According to the information presently available to the New

Jersey Department of Health, 1-Propanethiol has not been
tested for its ability to affect reproduction.
Other Effects
f 1-Propanethiol can irritate the lungs. Repeated exposure

may cause bronchitis to develop with coughing, phlegm,
and/or shortness of breath.

Medical
Medical Testing
If symptoms develop or overexposure is suspected, the
following are recommended:
f Lung function tests

Any evaluation should include a careful history of past and
present symptoms with an exam. Medical tests that look for
damage already done are not a substitute for controlling
exposure.
Request copies of your medical testing. You have a legal right
to this information under the OSHA Access to Employee
Exposure and Medical Records Standard (29 CFR 1910.1020).
Mixed Exposures
f Smoking can cause heart disease, lung cancer,
emphysema, and other respiratory problems. It may worsen
respiratory conditions caused by chemical exposure. Even if
you have smoked for a long time, stopping now will reduce
your risk of developing health problems.

1-PROPANETHIOL
Workplace Controls and Practices
Very toxic chemicals, or those that are reproductive hazards or
sensitizers, require expert advice on control measures if a less
toxic chemical cannot be substituted. Control measures
include: (1) enclosing chemical processes for severely
irritating and corrosive chemicals, (2) using local exhaust
ventilation for chemicals that may be harmful with a single
exposure, and (3) using general ventilation to control
exposures to skin and eye irritants. For further information on
workplace controls, consult the NIOSH document on Control
Banding at www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ctrlbanding/.
The following work practices are also recommended:
f Label process containers.
f Provide employees with hazard information and training.
f Monitor airborne chemical concentrations.
f Use engineering controls if concentrations exceed

f All protective clothing (suits, gloves, footwear, headgear)

should be clean, available each day, and put on before work.
Eye Protection
f Wear indirect-vent, impact and splash resistant goggles
when working with liquids.
f If additional protection is needed for the entire face, use in
combination with a face shield. A face shield should not be
used without another type of eye protection.
Respiratory Protection
Improper use of respirators is dangerous. Respirators
should only be used if the employer has implemented a written
program that takes into account workplace conditions,
requirements for worker training, respirator fit testing, and
medical exams, as described in the OSHA Respiratory
Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134).

recommended exposure levels.
f Provide eye wash fountains and emergency showers.
f Wash or shower if skin comes in contact with a hazardous

material.
f Always wash at the end of the workshift.
f Change into clean clothing if clothing becomes
contaminated.
f Do not take contaminated clothing home.
f Get special training to wash contaminated clothing.
f Do not eat, smoke, or drink in areas where chemicals are
being handled, processed or stored.
f Wash hands carefully before eating, smoking, drinking,
applying cosmetics or using the toilet.
In addition, the following may be useful or required:
f Before entering a confined space where 1-Propanethiol

may be present, check to make sure that an explosive
concentration does not exist.
f Where possible, transfer 1-Propanethiol from drums or
other containers to process containers in an enclosed
system.

Personal Protective Equipment
The OSHA Personal Protective Equipment Standard (29 CFR
1910.132) requires employers to determine the appropriate
personal protective equipment for each hazard and to train
employees on how and when to use protective equipment.
The following recommendations are only guidelines and may
not apply to every situation.
Gloves and Clothing
f Avoid skin contact with 1-Propanethiol. Wear personal
protective equipment made from material which can not be
permeated or degraded by this substance. Safety
equipment suppliers and manufacturers can provide
recommendations on the most protective glove and clothing
material for your operation.
f Safety equipment manufacturers recommend Butyl, Viton
and Barrier® as glove materials for Sulfur compounds, and
Tychem® BR, LV, Responder®, and TK, or the equivalent,
as protective clothing materials for Sulfur compounds.

f Where the potential exists for exposure over 0.5 ppm, use a

NIOSH approved full facepiece respirator with an organic
vapor cartridge. Increased protection is obtained from full
facepiece powered-air purifying respirators.
f Leave the area immediately if (1) while wearing a filter or
cartridge respirator you can smell, taste, or otherwise detect
1-Propanethiol, (2) while wearing particulate filters
abnormal resistance to breathing is experienced, or (3) eye
irritation occurs while wearing a full facepiece respirator.
Check to make sure the respirator-to-face seal is still good.
If it is, replace the filter or cartridge. If the seal is no longer
good, you may need a new respirator.
f Consider all potential sources of exposure in your workplace.
You may need a combination of filters, prefilters or cartridges
to protect against different forms of a chemical (such as
vapor and mist) or against a mixture of chemicals.
f Where the potential exists for exposure over 5 ppm, use a
NIOSH approved supplied-air respirator with a full facepiece
operated in a pressure-demand or other positive-pressure
mode. For increased protection use in combination with an
auxiliary self-contained breathing apparatus operated in a
pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode.

Fire Hazards
If employees are expected to fight fires, they must be trained
and equipped as stated in the OSHA Fire Brigades Standard
(29 CFR 1910.156).
f 1-Propanethiol is a FLAMMABLE LIQUID.
f Use dry chemical, CO2, water spray, alcohol-resistant foam

or other foam as extinguishing agents.
f Water may not be effective in fighting fires.
f POISONOUS GASES ARE PRODUCED IN FIRE, including

Hydrogen Sulfide and Sulfur Oxides.
f CONTAINERS MAY EXPLODE IN FIRE.
f Use water spray to keep fire-exposed containers cool.
f Vapors may travel to a source of ignition and flash back.
f Vapor is heavier than air and may travel a distance to cause

a fire or explosion far from the source.
f Flow or agitation may generate electrostatic discharges.
