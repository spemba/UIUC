HAZARD SUMMARY

WORKPLACE EXPOSURE LIMITS

*
*
*
*

1-Heptanethiol can affect you when breathed in.
Contact can irritate the skin and eyes.
Breathing 1-Heptanethiol can irritate the nose and throat.
Exposure to 1-Heptanethiol can cause headache,
dizziness, nausea and vomiting.

IDENTIFICATION
1-Heptanethiol is a colorless liquid with a strong odor. It is a
chemical intermediate used in making fuels, dyes,
pharmaceuticals, and other chemicals.

REASON FOR CITATION
* 1-Heptanethiol is on the Hazardous Substance List
because it is cited by DOT and NIOSH.
* Definitions are provided on page 5.

HOW TO DETERMINE IF YOU ARE BEING
EXPOSED
The New Jersey Right to Know Act requires most employers
to label chemicals in the workplace and requires public
employers to provide their employees with information and
training concerning chemical hazards and controls. The
federal OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, 1910.1200,
requires private employers to provide similar training and
information to their employees.
* Exposure to hazardous substances should be routinely
evaluated. This may include collecting personal and area
air samples. You can obtain copies of sampling results
from your employer. You have a legal right to this
information under OSHA 1910.1020.
* If you think you are experiencing any work-related health
problems, see a doctor trained to recognize occupational
diseases. Take this Fact Sheet with you.

NIOSH:

The recommended airborne exposure limit is
0.5 ppm, which should not be exceeded at any
time.

WAYS OF REDUCING EXPOSURE
* Where possible, enclose operations and use local exhaust
ventilation at the site of chemical release. If local exhaust
ventilation or enclosure is not used, respirators should be
worn.
* Wear protective work clothing.
* Wash thoroughly immediately after exposure to
1-Heptanethiol and at the end of the workshift.
* Post hazard and warning information in the work area. In
addition, as part of an ongoing education and training
effort, communicate all information on the health and
safety hazards of 1-Heptanethiol to potentially exposed
workers.

1-HEPTANETHIOL
This Fact Sheet is a summary source of information of all
potential and most severe health hazards that may result from
exposure.
Duration of exposure, concentration of the
substance and other factors will affect your susceptibility to
any of the potential effects described below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

HEALTH HAZARD INFORMATION
Acute Health Effects
The following acute (short-term) health effects may occur
immediately or shortly after exposure to 1-Heptanethiol:

page 2 of 6

WORKPLACE CONTROLS AND PRACTICES
Unless a less toxic chemical can be substituted for a hazardous
substance, ENGINEERING CONTROLS are the most
effective way of reducing exposure. The best protection is to
enclose operations and/or provide local exhaust ventilation at
the site of chemical release. Isolating operations can also
reduce exposure. Using respirators or protective equipment is
less effective than the controls mentioned above, but is
sometimes necessary.

* Contact can irritate the skin and eyes.
* Breathing 1-Heptanethiol can irritate the nose and throat.
* Exposure to 1-Heptanethiol can cause headache,
dizziness, nausea and vomiting.

In evaluating the controls present in your workplace, consider:
(1) how hazardous the substance is, (2) how much of the
substance is released into the workplace and (3) whether
harmful skin or eye contact could occur. Special controls
should be in place for highly toxic chemicals or when
significant skin, eye, or breathing exposures are possible.

Chronic Health Effects

In addition, the following control is recommended:

The following chronic (long-term) health effects can occur at
some time after exposure to 1-Heptanethiol and can last for
months or years:

Cancer Hazard
* According to the information presently available to the
New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services,
1-Heptanethiol has not been tested for its ability to cause
cancer in animals.

Reproductive Hazard
* According to the information presently available to the
New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services,
1-Heptanethiol has not been tested for its ability to affect
reproduction.

Other Long-Term Effects
* 1-Heptanethiol has not been tested for other chronic
(long-term) health effects.

MEDICAL
Medical Testing
There is no special test for this chemical. However, if illness
occurs or overexposure is suspected, medical attention is
recommended.
Any evaluation should include a careful history of past and
present symptoms with an exam. Medical tests that look for
damage already done are not a substitute for controlling
exposure.
Request copies of your medical testing. You have a legal
right to this information under OSHA 1910.1020.

* Where
possible,
automatically
pump
liquid
1-Heptanethiol from drums or other storage containers to
process containers.
Good WORK PRACTICES can help to reduce hazardous
exposures. The following work practices are recommended:
* Workers whose clothing has been contaminated by
1-Heptanethiol should change into clean clothing
promptly.
* Contaminated work clothes should be laundered by
individuals who have been informed of the hazards of
exposure to 1-Heptanethiol.
* Eye wash fountains should be provided in the immediate
work area for emergency use.
* If there is the possibility of skin exposure, emergency
shower facilities should be provided.
* On skin contact with 1-Heptanethiol, immediately wash
or shower to remove the chemical.
* Do not eat, smoke, or drink where 1-Heptanethiol is
handled, processed, or stored, since the chemical can be
swallowed. Wash hands carefully before eating, drinking,
smoking, or using the toilet.

PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
WORKPLACE CONTROLS ARE BETTER THAN
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. However, for
some jobs (such as outside work, confined space entry, jobs
done only once in a while, or jobs done while workplace
controls are being installed), personal protective equipment
may be appropriate.
OSHA 1910.132 requires employers to determine the
appropriate personal protective equipment for each hazard and
to train employees on how and when to use protective
equipment.

not apply to every situation.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q:

Clothing
* Avoid skin contact with 1-Heptanethiol. Wear protective
gloves and clothing. Safety equipment suppliers/
manufacturers can provide recommendations on the most
protective glove/clothing material for your operation.
* All protective clothing (suits, gloves, footwear, headgear)
should be clean, available each day, and put on before
work.

Eye Protection
* Wear indirect-vent, impact and splash resistant goggles
when working with liquids.
* Wear a face shield along with goggles when working with
corrosive, highly irritating or toxic substances.

Respiratory Protection
IMPROPER USE OF RESPIRATORS IS DANGEROUS.
Such equipment should only be used if the employer has a
written program that takes into account workplace conditions,
requirements for worker training, respirator fit testing and
medical exams, as described in OSHA 1910.134.
* Where the potential exists for exposure over 0.5 ppm, use
a MSHA/NIOSH approved full facepiece respirator with
an organic vapor cartridge. Increased protection is
obtained from full facepiece powered-air purifying
respirators.
* If while wearing a filter or cartridge respirator you can
smell, taste, or otherwise detect 1-Heptanethiol, or if
while wearing particulate filters abnormal resistance to
breathing is experienced, or eye irritation occurs while
wearing a full facepiece respirator, leave the area
immediately. Check to make sure the respirator-to-face
seal is still good. If it is, replace the filter or cartridge. If
the seal is no longer good, you may need a new respirator.
* Be sure to consider all potential exposures in your
workplace. You may need a combination of filters,
prefilters or cartridges to protect against different forms of
a chemical (such as vapor and mist) or against a mixture of
chemicals.
* Where the potential for high exposure exists, use a
MSHA/NIOSH approved supplied-air respirator with a full
facepiece operated in a pressure-demand or other positivepressure mode.
For increased protection use in
combination with an auxiliary self-contained breathing
apparatus operated in a pressure-demand or other positivepressure mode.

If I have acute health effects, will I later get chronic
health effects?
Not always. Most chronic (long-term) effects result
from repeated exposures to a chemical.
Can I get long-term effects without ever having shortterm effects?
Yes, because long-term effects can occur from repeated
exposures to a chemical at levels not high enough to
make you immediately sick.
What are my chances of getting sick when I have been
exposed to chemicals?
The likelihood of becoming sick from chemicals is
increased as the amount of exposure increases. This is
determined by the length of time and the amount of
material to which someone is exposed.

Q:
A:

When are higher exposures more likely?
Conditions which increase risk of exposure include
physical and mechanical processes (heating, pouring,
spraying, spills and evaporation from large surface areas
such as open containers), and "confined space"
exposures (working inside vats, reactors, boilers, small
rooms, etc.).

Q:

Is the risk of getting sick higher for workers than for
community residents?
Yes. Exposures in the community, except possibly in
cases of fires or spills, are usually much lower than those
found in the workplace. However, people in the
community may be exposed to contaminated water as
well as to chemicals in the air over long periods. This
may be a problem for children or people who are already
ill.
